A: React
1. Vite: Next Generation Frontend Tooling
	- installs and starts react appln in seconds
2. Create React app with Tailwind Css 



B: Smart Contract
1. npm init -y: Initilizes empty package.json
2. npm i ethers => Allow us to iteract with blockchain and smart Contract
3. npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
4. Hardhat: Ethereum development environment + Run Solidity locally
5. Solidity: New Prog. lang. used for ethereum blockchain
	5.1. Combination of few languages: Inspired by Js,CPP,Rust,Java,etc.
6. Choose Solidity Version: pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

11. Hardhat-Waffle: Plugin to build smart contract tests using Waffle in Hardhat
12. Modify hardhat.config.js file with proper details. 
13. Now we have
		a) A Config file
		b) Solidity Smart Contract
		c) Script to deploy contract
14. Run Command: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ropsten
